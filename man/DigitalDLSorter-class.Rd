\title{The DigitalDLSorter Class}
\description{
The DigitalDLSorter object is the core of \code{digitalDLSorteR}. This object
stores different intermediate data resulting from the creation of new
context-specific deconvolution models from single-cell data. It is only used
in the case of building new deconvolution models. To deconvolute bulk samples
using pre-trained models, see \code{\link{deconvDigitalDLSorter}} function
and the package \pkg{digitalDLSorteRdata}.
}
\details{
This object uses other classes to store the different types of data produced
during the process: \itemize{ \item \code{\linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}}
class for single-cell RNA-Seq data, using sparse matrix from the \pkg{Matrix}
package (\code{\linkS4class{dgCMatrix}} class) or \code{HDF5Array} class in
the case of using HDF5 files as back-end (see below for more information).
\item \code{\linkS4class{ZinbModel}} class with estimated parameters for the
simulation of new single-cell profiles. \item
\code{\linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}} class for large bulk RNA-Seq data
storage. \item \code{\linkS4class{ProbMatrixCellTypes}} class for the
compositional cell matrices constructed during the process. See
\code{?\linkS4class{ProbMatrixCellTypes}} for details. \item
\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorterDNN}} class to store the information
related to Deep Neural Network models. This step is performed using
\code{keras}. See \code{?\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorterDNN}} for details. }

\pkg{digitalDLSorteR} can be used in two ways: to build new deconvolution
models from single-cell RNA-Seq data or to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq samples
using pre-trained models available at \pkg{digitalDLSorteRdata} package. If
you want to build new models, see \code{\link{loadSCProfiles}} function. On
the other hand, if you want to use pre-trained models, see
\code{\link{deconvDigitalDLSorter}} function.

In order to provide a way to work with large amounts of data on
RAM-constrained machines, we provide the possibility to use HDF5 files as
back-end to store count matrices of both real/simulated single-cell and bulk
RNA-Seq profiles. For this, the package uses the \code{HDF5Array} and
\code{DelayedArray} classes from the homonymous packages.

Once the Deep Neural Network model has been trained trained, it is possible
to save it as RDS or HDF5 files. Please see
\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorterDNN}} for more details.
