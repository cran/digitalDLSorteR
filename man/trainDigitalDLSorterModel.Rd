\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorter}} object with
\code{single.cell.real}/\code{single.cell.simul}, \code{prob.cell.matrix}
and \code{bulk.simul} slots.}

\item{combine}{Type of profiles to be used for training. Can be
\code{'both'}, \code{'single-cell'} or \code{'bulk'} (\code{'both'} by
default). For test data, both types of profiles will be used.}

\item{batch.size}{Number of samples per gradient update. If not specified,
\code{batch.size} will default to 64.}

\item{num.epochs}{Number of epochs to train the model (10 by default).}

\item{num.hidden.layers}{Number of hidden layers of the neural network (2 by
default). This number must be equal to the length of \code{num.units}
argument.}

\item{num.units}{Vector indicating the number of neurons per hidden layer
(\code{c(200, 200)} by default). The length of this vector must be equal to
\code{num.hidden.layers} argument.}

\item{activation.fun}{Activation function to use (\code{'relu'} by default).
See the
\href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/activation_relu.html}{keras
documentation} to know available activation functions.}

\item{dropout.rate}{Float between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of the
input neurons to drop in layer dropouts (0.25 by default). By default,
\pkg{digitalDLSorteR} implements 1 dropout layer per hidden layer.}

\item{loss}{Character indicating loss function selected for model training
(\code{'kullback_leibler_divergence'} by default). See the
\href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/loss-functions.html}{keras
documentation} to know available loss functions.}

\item{metrics}{Vector of metrics used to assess model performance during
training and evaluation (\code{c("accuracy", "mean_absolute_error",
  "categorical_accuracy")} by default). See the
\href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/metric_binary_accuracy.html}{keras
documentation} to know available performance metrics.}

\item{scaling}{How to scale data before training. It may be:
\code{"standarize"} (values are centered around the mean with a unit
standard deviation) or \code{"rescale"} (values are shifted and rescaled so
that they end up ranging between 0 and 1).}

\item{custom.model}{Allows to use a custom neural network. It must be a
\code{keras.engine.sequential.Sequential} object in which the number of
input neurons is equal to the number of considered features/genes, and the
number of output neurons is equal to the number of cell types considered
(\code{NULL} by default). If provided, the arguments related to the neural
network architecture will be ignored.}

\item{shuffle}{Boolean indicating whether data will be shuffled (\code{TRUE}
by default). Note that if \code{bulk.simul} is not \code{NULL}, the data
already has been shuffled and \code{shuffle} will be ignored.}

\item{on.the.fly}{Boolean indicating whether data will be generated 'on the
fly' during training (\code{FALSE} by default).}

\item{pseudobulk.function}{Function used to build pseudo-bulk samples. It may
be: \itemize{ \item \code{"MeanCPM"}: single-cell profiles (raw counts) are
transformed into CPMs and cross-cell averages are calculated. Then,
\code{log2(CPM + 1)} is calculated. \item \code{"AddCPM"}: single-cell
profiles (raw counts) are transformed into CPMs and are added up across
cells. Then, log-CPMs are calculated. \item \code{"AddRawCount"}:
single-cell profiles (raw counts) are added up across cells. Then, log-CPMs
are calculated.}}

\item{threads}{Number of threads used during simulation of pseudo-bulk
samples if \code{on.the.fly = TRUE} (1 by default).}

\item{view.metrics.plot}{Boolean indicating whether to show plots of loss and
metrics progression during training (\code{TRUE} by default). \pkg{keras}
for R allows to see the progression of the model during training if you are
working in RStudio.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean indicating whether to display model progression during
training and model architecture information (\code{TRUE} by default).}

\value{
A \code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorter}} object with
\code{trained.model} slot containing a
\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorterDNN}} object. For more information about
the structure of this class, see \code{?\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorterDNN}}.
}
\description{
Train a Deep Neural Network model using the training data from
\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorter}} object. In addition, the trained model
is evaluated with test data and prediction results are otained to determine
its performance (see \code{?\link{calculateEvalMetrics}}). Training and
evaluation can be performed using simulated profiles stored in the
\code{\linkS4class{DigitalDLSorter}} object or 'on the fly' by simulating the
pseudo-bulk profiles at the same time as the training/evaluation is performed
(see Details).
}
\details{
\strong{Keras/Tensorflow environment}

All Deep Learning related steps in the \pkg{digitalDLSorteR} package are
performed by using the \pkg{keras} package, an API in R for \pkg{keras} in
Python available on CRAN. We recommend using the installation guide available
at \url{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/} in order to set a more customized
configuration.

\strong{Simulation of bulk RNA-Seq profiles 'on the fly'}

\code{trainDigitalDLSorterModel} allows to avoid storing bulk RNA-Seq
profiles by using \code{on.the.fly} argument. This functionality aims to
avoid exexcution times and memory usage of the \code{simBulkProfiles}
function, as the simulated pseudo-bulk profiles are built in each batch
during training/evaluation.

\strong{Neural network architecture}

By default, \code{\link{trainDigitalDLSorterModel}} implements the
architecture selected in Torroja and Sánchez-Cabo, 2019. However, as the
default architecture may not produce good results depending on the dataset,
it is possible to change its parameters by using the corresponding argument:
number of hidden layers, number of neurons for each hidden layer, dropout
rate, activation function and loss function. For more customized models, it
is possible to provide a pre-built model in the \code{custom.model} argument
(a \code{keras.engine.sequential.Sequential} object) where it is necessary
that the number of input neurons is equal to the number of considered
features/genes and the number of output neurons is equal to the number of
considered cell types.
